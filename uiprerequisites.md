# Prerequisite 1:-
## Install Node JS

https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Install latest from LTS (Long Term Support) version list.

Node will ne install with NPM (Package Manager)

NPM is the package manager for JavaScript and the world’s largest software registry. Discover packages of reusable code — and assemble them in powerful new ways.

# Prerequisite 2:-
## Installing Git

# Prerequisite 3 (Optional):-
## Install Yarn

https://yarnpkg.com/en/

Yarn caches every package it downloads so it never needs to download it again. It also parallelizes operations to maximize resource utilization so install times are faster than ever.

We should use either Yarn or NPM

Open CMD for windows ( Terminal for Linux)
```
npm install -g yarn
```
